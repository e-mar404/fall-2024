# Week 3 - Process

## What is it

- a sequence of execution of a procedure
- how a procedure consumes the computational resources

## Iterative vs Recursive

### Iterative

- a procedure or process is considered iterative when it loops through a set of values to perform a certain operation
- state is determined by fixed set of variables and rules

**Process**

- carries a series of steps
- stop any time and resume later

### Recursive

- it is considered recursive when it calls itself to fulfill the operation
- there is a phase of expansion with deferred evaluation followed by a phase of contraction
- interpreter or runtime needs to keep track of deferred computations

**Process**

- highly expensive
- requires to carry the current chain or sequence of calls
- should not be avoided at all costs
